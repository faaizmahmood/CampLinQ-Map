# CampLinQ-Map

CampLinQ-Map is a website designed to help users plan their camping trips with ease and precision. The site offers a user-friendly interface where users can input various filters such as booking dates, pitch size, and pitch shadow preferences (e.g., highways, tolls, ferries) to receive tailored route suggestions and recommendations for the best camping spots to visit.

As the developer, my goal was to ensure full client satisfaction by delivering a website that not only met but exceeded expectations. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing front-end interface.

I am proud to say that the project achieved a 5/5 star review(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) from the client, reflecting their complete satisfaction with the service provided and the website's functionality.
